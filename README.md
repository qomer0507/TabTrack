## Features

- Track active tab time by domain  
- View usage by day, week, or all-time  
- Clear tracking history with one click  
- Data stored locally in the browser  
- Simple, clean interface with scrollable view  
- Auto-sync updates between tabs and popup  

## Why I Built This

I wanted a privacy-friendly, no-login tool to measure how I actually spend time online without relying on third-party trackers or heavy productivity apps. TabTrack gives simple focus insights with minimal overhead, built entirely on browser APIs.

## Future Update Ideas

- Visual charts or time trends  
- Focus score algorithm  
- Grouping domains by category (e.g., social, work, etc.)
