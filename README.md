# TabTrack â€“ Chrome Extension for Smarter Browsing

TabTrack is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps users understand how they spend time online. It locally and privately tracks time spent on each website and displays usage statistics by day, week, or all time.

## Features

- Track active tab time by domain  
- View usage by day, week, or all-time  
- Clear tracking history with one click  
- Data stored locally in the browser  
- Simple, clean interface with scrollable view  
- Auto-sync updates between tabs and popup  

## Why I Built This

I wanted a privacy-friendly, no-login tool to measure how I actually spend time online without relying on third-party trackers or heavy productivity apps. TabTrack gives simple focus insights with minimal overhead, built entirely on browser APIs.

## Future Update Ideas

- Visual charts or time trends  
- Focus score algorithm  
- Grouping domains by category (e.g., social, work, etc.)
